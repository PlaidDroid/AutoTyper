# AutoTyper

> _The robot typer._

Ever had a situation wherein the copy-paste trick doesn't workout? Well, I've been there, and as they say, '_Necessity is the mother of invention_'. So, this software types in for you. Yes there are perhaps other free software that does just that, but I couldn't find any that actually helped, and so I wrote one myself (I should have looked harder).

## Instructions 📖
Just write your ~sh\*t~ stuff onto a file, select it, and _voilà_.

## Features 🍴
👐  Hands-free  
🚗  Rush or Drag  
⏲️  Take your own time starting  
🔡  Nothing binds you, write away*  
📜  Nice UI  

\**we all know that's not true, don't we? everything has to end eventually*

## Installation 📦
Download the package for your platform. And run it.

## Disclaimer 🚨
I'm figuring out packaging and so obviously these builds haven't been tested properly. Sorry for the inconvenience.
#### Windows
You'll not find the application in the start menu. But you'll find it in `C:\Program Files\AutoTyper\AutoTyper.exe`. And it works.
#### Others
You guys can run the jar for now, or maybe test the packages for me.
- Make sure java is installed
- Open Command Prompt or Terminal
- `cd` to the location of the `.jar` file. eg. `cd Downloads` 
- `java -jar AutoTyper-1.x.x-shaded.jar`
- Hopefully will open the GUI

## ToDo 🚧
- [ ] Text area (I forgot about that)
- [ ] Randomness
- [ ] Countdown
